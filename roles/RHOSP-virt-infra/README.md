RHOSP-virt-infra
=========

The role creates a virtual infrastructure for Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

Requirements
------------

It's tested to work on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8.4 system.

Role Variables
--------------

RHOSP_version: **16.2**|16.1|13.0
  This variable sets the version of RHOSP to install.

cleanup: **False**|True
  This variable sets if the resources (domains, networks, storage) should be cleaned before the creation process.

create: **True**|False
  This variable sets if the resources (domains, networks, storage) should be created. Useful in combination with cleanup:True to wipe the lab environment.

external_if: eno1
  This variable sets the interface that connects the hypervisor with the Internet.

overcloud_ip: 10.0.0.254
  This variable sets the overcloud virtual IP (used for example to access Horizon)

forwarded_ports: [80,6080,5000]
  List of ports to be forwarded to the overcloud IP (enabling access to Horizon using the hypervisor IP address)

vms: []
  List of the virtual machines to be created, in the format:
```yaml
  - name: VM_NAME
    title: 'VM_TITLE'
    profile: 'undercloud'|'control'|'compute'
    memory: RAM_IN_KB
    vcpus: AMOUNT_OF_CPUS
    bmcport: VBMC_PORT_TO_ASSIGN
    mac: 'XX:XX:XX:XX:XX' (without the last octet)
    disk_size: DISK_SIZE_IN_KB
    backing_store: 'QCOW2_IMAGE' (image to use as base for the disk)
    cdrom: 'CDROM_IMAGE' (image to insert as cdrom, useful for cloud-init)
    nics:
      NETWORK_NAME_1: 'IP_ADDRESS_1'
      NETWORK_NAME_2: 'IP_ADDRESS_2'
      ...
```
  By default the role creates:
    - undercloud
    - controller0
    - compute0

networks: []
  List of the virtual networks to be created. The default values should work. You can replace or add the hypervisor_if values to set wich interfaces in the hypervisor are linked to each bridge (useful to connect physical nodes to the lab).
```yaml
networks:
  - name: RHOSPVirtLab_ctlplane
    bridge: br-ctlplane
    forward: false
    mac_suffix: '00'
    ipv4: false
    hypervisor_if: eno2
  - name: RHOSPVirtLab_vlans
    bridge: br-vlans
    forward: false
    mac_suffix: '01'
    ipv4: false
    hypervisor_if: eno3
  - name: RHOSPVirtLab_external
    bridge: br-external
    forward: route
    mac_suffix: '05'
    ipv4:
      address: '10.0.0.1'
      netmask: '255.255.255.0'
      dhcp: false
  - name: RHOSPVirtLab_management
    bridge: br-management
    forward: nat
    mac_suffix: '0f'
    ipv4:
      address: '192.168.250.1'
      netmask: '255.255.255.0'
      dhcp:
        start: '192.168.250.100'
        end: '192.168.250.254'
        hosts: true
```

Example Playbook
----------------

```yaml
- name: Infrastructure configuration
  hosts: infrastructure
  vars_files:
    - vars/options.yml
    - vars/vms.yml
    - vars/networks.yml
    - vars/overcloud.yml
  pre_tasks:
    - name: Set ansible_user to the current user
      set_fact:
        ansible_user: "{{ lookup('env','USER') }}"
  roles:
    - role: RHOSP-virt-infra
